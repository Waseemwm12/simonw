# Tools I use for my weeknotes

I use these to help write [my weeknotes](https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/):

- [TILs created in the past two weeks, as Markdown](https://til.simonwillison.net/tils?sql=select+%27*+%5B%27+%7C%7C+title+%7C%7C+%27%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Ftil.simonwillison.net%2F%27+%7C%7C+topic+%7C%7C+%27%2F%27+%7C%7C+slug+%7C%7C+%27%29%27+as+md+from+til+where+created_utc+%3E%3D+date%28%27now%27%2C+%27-14+days%27%29+order+by+created_utc+limit+101)
- I get releases from [this page](https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/main/releases.md)
- [My recent commits across all projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=author%3Asimonw&s=committer-date&type=Commits)
